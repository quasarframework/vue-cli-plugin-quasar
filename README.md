Please submit a PR to https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-awesome with your website/app/Quasar tutorial/video etc. Thank you!

## Getting started

:warning:  Make sure you have vue-cli v5:

```
vue --version
```

If you don't have a project created with vue-cli v5 yet:

```
vue create my-app
```

Navigate to the newly created project folder and add the cli plugin. Before installing it, make sure to commit your current changes should you wish to revert them later.

```
$ cd my-app
$ yarn add --dev vue-cli-plugin-quasar
$ vue invoke quasar
```

It will ask you if you want the plugin to replace some existing files. It is recommended that you do it if you wish to have an example so you can quickly develop your app.

Your Vue config (in package.json or vue.config.js file, depending on what you chose when you created your vue app) will also contain a `quasar` Object.

### Issue Reporting Guidelines

**Please use the appropriate Github repo to report issues. See "Related Components" above.** For example, a bug related to CLI should be reported to the CLI repo, one related to build issues to Quasar Framework Templates repo and so on.

- The issue list of the repository is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. For anything else please use the [Community Forum](https://forum.quasar.dev).

- Try to search for your issue, it may have already been fixed in the development branch or it may have a resolution.

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Quasar. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, donâ€™t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.
